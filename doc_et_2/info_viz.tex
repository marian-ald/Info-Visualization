\textbf{\large{Questions}}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the CO$_2$ distribution over time? In which period of the year are produced the biggest CO${_2}$ emissions by Westeros missions?
	\item Where(countries, continents) do most of the users travel? (Distribution of trips to certain places).
	\item How much CO${_2}$ emissions are produced to go to certain places?(Distribution of CO$_2$ over the countries). 
	\item Is the mission mode correlated with the distance/country?
	\item What are the CO${_2}$ emissions for a certain rank/title/house?
	\item Which rank/title/house spent the most time in missions?
	\item Which rank/title/house traveled the longest distance?
	\item Which rank/title/house completed most of the missions?

\end{enumerate}



I will also consider some of the questions proposed on the project website for the next step.
